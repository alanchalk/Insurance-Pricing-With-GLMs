# Introduction


Dear Reader,

Can we fit good GLMs?  

Can we rely mostly on the data to choose which features to select?

Can we fit those features accurately, with manual smoothing left as close to the end of the process as possible?

Some techniques to start us on this journey are discussed in the CAS monograph: From GLMs to Comprehensive Insurance Pricing: Techniques and Challenges.  

We include here R code to help the reader try out those techniques.
