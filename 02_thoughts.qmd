Naming Conventions for Features
Importance of consistent naming conventions.
Guidelines for feature names:
Use clear and descriptive names.
Avoid spaces, special characters, or overly long names.
Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate feature type (e.g., num_ for numeric, cat_ for categorical).
Code examples for renaming features systematically in R or Python.
2. Character and Numeric Features
Handling different data types:
Converting character features to factors or strings.
Ensuring numeric features are stored in the correct format.
Identifying and correcting anomalies in data types.
Example code to inspect and standardize feature data types.
3. Feature Screening
The importance of selecting relevant features.
Methods for feature screening:
Univariate analysis (e.g., variance thresholds, correlation).
Multivariate techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, LASSO).
Code examples for applying these techniques.
4. Missing Values and General Sense-Checking
Identifying missing values and patterns in the data.
Strategies for handling missing values:
Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, or model-based).
Dropping rows or columns with excessive missingness.
General quality checks:
Outlier detection.
Logical consistency of values (e.g., negative ages or invalid dates).
Example code for each approach
