Naming Conventions for Features Importance of consistent naming conventions. Guidelines for feature names: Use clear and descriptive names. Avoid spaces, special characters, or overly long names. Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate feature type (e.g., num\_ for numeric, cat\_ for categorical). Code examples for renaming features systematically in R or Python.

2.  Character and Numeric Features Handling different data types: Converting character features to factors or strings. Ensuring numeric features are stored in the correct format. Identifying and correcting anomalies in data types. Example code to inspect and standardize feature data types.


4.  Missing Values When missing - during analysis or at time of quote need consistency - if during analysis we replace with mode but at time of quote there is a line in the table for missing example - enrichment goes down - assume load at time of quote since in highly competitive market will quickly such in high risks - then very likely that mean imputation is not going to be good Identifying missing values and patterns in the data. Strategies for handling missing values: Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, or model-based). Dropping rows or columns with excessive missingness.

5 General Sense-Checking General quality checks: Outlier detection. Logical consistency of values (e.g., negative ages or invalid dates). Example code for each approach ---

Feature Screening The importance of selecting relevant features. Methods for feature screening: Univariate analysis (e.g., variance thresholds, correlation). Multivariate techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, LASSO). Code examples for applying these techniques.
